    React is taking the web development world by storm! Thanks to Facebook's
    excellent engineering team, and the countless public contributors helping
    not only with react core, but the entire react community, we can all help
    push component based frontends forward.


    This group is for those interested in the React.js scene, both new and
    experienced.

        Test Driven Development with React

        Test Driven Development emphasises quick iterations for your code. You
        won't code faster, but perhaps you will be more accurate.


        TDD has been around for a while and I have avoided it for most of my
        career. I decided for the month of October all code I write I will do
        TDD. The result was much more positive than I thought it would be and
        made me rethink how I code. This talk covers the testing pyramid, the
        importance of unit testing and the tools I use for testing React. As
        part of the talk I will work through a trivial example to demonstrate
        how to do TDD.

        Concurrent Mode

        _ An introduction to the use cases, patterns and gotchas in React's
        Concurrent Mode


        After a brief explanation of what Concurrent mode is, we'll build an
        example application which progressively introduces each of the API's
        while showing what benefits they bring, the patterns we can leverage,
        and the gotchas to watch out for.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
